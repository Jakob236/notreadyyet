# Welcome!

Hello everyone and welcome to our project. We are happy that you are interested in our website!
We, Jakob Thielmann and Luca Grolms, are currently studying the masters program “Cognitive & Integrative System Neurosciences“ at Philipps University Marburg. On this website we present our project “not ready yet“ that we worked on as part of the module “Methodological work in the neurosciences” during the summer term 2021.
  

## What's all this now?

At first we have to admit, that our project name "not ready yet" is a result of our lack of creativity. So there's no correlation to our project. 
Correlation? Oh what a transition to our real topic, the effect of depression on our brain. In this project we would like to reproduce a study with the same data set but different processing tools. At the end we will compare our results to the results of the publication.


The project includes the following parts:

* [Overview & motivation]()


* [Project outline & management plan]()


* [Dataset & management plan]()


* [Pre-registration]()


* [Open lab notebook]()
 
      
* [Data analyses]()

   
* [Results & outcomes]()


* [Poster & manuscript]()


* [Data access]()


* [Code of Conduct](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive experience.

# Overview & motivation

Please provide a short description of your project.

* What is the current situation/problem, what are the aims of the project?

Ioannidis (2005) claimed that most findings in the behavioral sciences are false and therefore, cannot be replicated. These claims were supported by Open Science Collaboration (2015). It was hypothesized that a lot of studies are underpowered and a lack of open communication about concrete procedures that were used would cause this so called „replication crisis“ (Nosek et al., 2015). The promotion of an open research culture where data that was used in studies is accessible for everyone and clear documentation how the study was conducted are proposed as solutions for this (Nosek et al., 2015). 
This project aims at investigating if the results of the following study Bezmaternykh et al. (2021) are reproducible with the tools that were used. 
This is relevant because the study aspires to identify concrete differences within the brain activity between healthy subjects and subjects that are diagnosed with depression. Furthermore, it was investigated how this changes pre and post different treatment options. The latter will not be investigated in this project. In applied life sciences and later steps the goal is to use this information to judge the effectiveness of treatments and to find characteristic brain activity patterns for depressed patients. Therefore, the results have to be reliable to draw conclusions in a clinical setting which affects the well-being of patients as well as how much money will be invested in which therapy option for an individual patient.
